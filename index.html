										<h2>NVMe-STAS over RoCE v2</h2>
										<p style="text-align:right;font-size:14px;color:#353744"><b>- (Interned at Cisco as SWE)</b></p>
									</header>
									<p>Enabled discovery and connection of CDCs over a RoCE v2 network for NVMe-STAS, a program that uses multiple <b>Python</b> scripts to automate the discovery and connection of 
										discovery controllers and I/O controllers using multiple daemon processes including well know daemons like Avahi, which was used 
										to discover those discovery controllers that advertised themselves with the appropriate Avahi-service types,
										using mDNS/DNS-SD.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/AshRvm/CS3205/tree/main/Assignment2">Tic Tac Toe Server</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>A TCP/IP server-client application built using <b>C</b>, that hosts tic-tac-toe games on the server side, capable of hosting multiple games
										at any instance, that pairs 2 players in the waiting queue immediately after a table becomes free. On the client side,
										displays the current board using the CLI and takes input from the same. This appliction takes care of cases where the 
										player inputs an invalid input or gets disconnected mid-game. Also has additional features like option to play again with 
										the same opponent once the match ends.

									</header>
									<p>A <b>Cuda</b> application that simulates ticket bookings for multiple trains, consisting of mulitple compartments each,
									    moving across various stations. These booking requests are taken in batches, and each batch is processed as parallel as
										possible, by appropriately storing, accessing and manipulating the data using the parallelism offered by Cuda.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/AshRvm/Discord-bot">Music Game Discord Bot</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>A discord bot, made using <b>JavaScript</b>, that was created to automate a game that can be played
										in discord servers, where the host plays certain songs and the contestants are to guess the name of the 
										song within a certain fixed interval. Creates an entry for every person present in the voice-channel during 
										the start of the game and automatically adds an entry if a player joins mid-round. Saves each player entries
										in case of a player getting disconnected.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/AshRvm/CS5691/tree/main/a4/Code">Classifier using ANN, SVM and KNN</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>Build various classifier models in <b>Python</b>, using ANN, SVM and KNN to classify various datasets,
									such as an image dataset, where each image is divided into a 6x6 block each consisting of a 23 dimension featured
									vector, and an isolated spoken-digit dataset, where each sound has it's sequences of spectral features extraced into mfcc files.
									The models were also tested with the datasets compressed using PCA and LDA.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/AshRvm/CS2610/tree/main/Lab_06">Cache Simulator</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>A cache simulator, build using <b>C</b>, that given a sequence of addresses to access, simulates the caches and 
									returns various performance readings of the cache, such as number of cold misses and number of conflict misses. Supports
									all 3 mapping schemes and also supports 3 replacement policies, namely, Random, LRU and Tree-based pseudo LRU.
